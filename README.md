QLoRA Fine-Tuning: Defect Fix Recommendation LLM

This project demonstrates how to perform QLoRA-based fine-tuning on a quantized large language model using a custom instruction dataset focused on software defects and their resolutions.

Project Overview:

* Base Model: google/gemma-3-1b-it (full precision)
* Quantization: 4-bit using bitsandbytes (nf4 + double quantization)
* Fine-Tuning: LoRA adapters using the peft library
* Final Model: Merged model with adapters included (approx. 919 MB)

Dataset:

The training data (defects\_instructions.json) contains instruction-response pairs.

Example:
Instruction: Defect: App crashes on login
Root cause: DOM element missing ID
Response: Use correct data binding syntax

Workflow Summary:

1. Load and quantize the base model to 4-bit
2. Prepare LoRA configuration (target modules, rank, alpha)
3. Tokenize the dataset using the model's tokenizer
4. Fine-tune with SFTTrainer (from trl)
5. Merge LoRA adapters into the base model
6. Save both model and tokenizer

Final Model Sizes:

Pre-QLoRA model: \~4.66 GB
Post-merge model: \~919 MB

Example Usage:

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from\_pretrained("merged-defect-model")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from\_pretrained("merged-defect-model")

prompt = "Defect: Button not clickable\nRoot cause: JS error"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return\_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
outputs = model.generate(\*\*inputs, max\_new\_tokens=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs\[0], skip\_special\_tokens=True))

Note:

This project does not include model weights. Please use your own base model checkpoint and quantize locally. Fine-tuning parameters should be adjusted based on GPU availability.
